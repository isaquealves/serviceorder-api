# Service Order API

This API was planned to attend some of my personal needs while a electronic devices technical assistance professional.
But it should help any other professionals in the same field to manage the entire process, from device reception to service order/estimate execution authorization.
Also, the objective is to keep track of the device history, allowing to easy identify new issues.

## Interested in contribute to development?

Please, if you think this is useful, don't be shy. You can fork the repo and submit your contributions. We will stick to good practices but any piece of code will be considered. Take a look at (API documentation)[https://github.com/isaquealves/serviceorder-doc] to have at least a little understanding of what is being proposed. And Thanks in advance.
